          <h2>Education History</h2>
          I was born and raised in the Seattle area so naturally I attended the University of Washington. Originally I was on a pre-med track but about 3 years into my degree I decided that I really did not want to pursue higher education. I finished my bachelor's in physiology and I'm now looking to pursue other interests outside of medicine.
